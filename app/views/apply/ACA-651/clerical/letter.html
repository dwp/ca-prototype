              Dear {{ dpName }}
            </p>

            <p>
              {{ carerName }} has made a claim to Carer’s Allowance on 28 September 2020. They told us they provide you with 35 hours of care or more a week. You do not need to do anything if this is correct.
            </p>

            <p>
              If {{ carerName }} does not care for you, or provides care for you for less than 35 hours a week, please tell us straightaway. You will need to have your National Insurance number if you call us.
            </p>

            <p>
              To get Carer’s Allowance a carer must provide 35 hours of care to someone who gets Personal Independence Payment, Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance, Constant Attendance Allowance or Armed Forces Independence Payment or an EU equivalent disability benefit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because of this we may look at details of any benefit claims you have made in order to process {{ carerName }}’s claim for Carer’s Allowance. We may also look at details of any benefit claims made on your behalf, for example those made by a partner if you have one.
            </p>

            <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How this could affect you</h4>

            <p>
              Some benefits can be affected if someone gets Carer’s Allowance for looking after you. The benefits that could be affected are set out below.
            </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>If you get income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-related Employment & Support Allowance, Income Support or Housing Benefit and the amount includes a Severe Disability Premium, you may no longer get  that premium</li>
              <li>If you get Pension Credit and the amount received includes an additional amount for Severe Disability, you may no longer get that additional amount</li>
            </ul>
