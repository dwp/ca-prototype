			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using this service</h2>

			<p>
				This service is run by the Department for Communities. We want as many
				people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that
				means you should be able to:
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
				<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>
					get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard
				</li>
				<li>
					get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition
					software
				</li>
				<li>
					listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent
					versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				We’ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to
				understand.

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this service is</h2>

			<p>Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>
					JAWS screen reader software may not read out all page headings in
					Internet Explorer 11 – this is a known issue with JAWS version 18 or
					above, we recommend using a different browser to avoid this problem
				</li>

				<li>
					JAWS voice packs – some JAWS voices incorrectly read the term ‘P45’ as
					‘45p’, this is a JAWS issue only affecting some voice packs
				</li>
				<li>
					Dragon speech recognition software – links that reveal hidden text on
					a page will not respond to the ‘click link’ command, but will respond
					to ‘click button’ – this is a
					<a
						href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/44#issuecomment-628082040"
						>known issue with the GOV.UK Design System details component</a
					>
				</li>
			</ul>
