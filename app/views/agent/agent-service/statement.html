				Accessibility statement for Report a change to Carer’s Allowance
			</h1>

			<p>
				This service is part of the wider GOV.UK website. There’s a separate
				<a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility"
					>accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website</a
				>.
			</p>

			<p>
				This page only contains information about the Report a change to Carer’s
				Allowance service, available at
				<a
					href="https://www.carersallowance.service.gov.uk/circumstances/report-changes/change-selection"
					>www.carersallowance.service.gov.uk/circumstances/report-changes/change-selection</a
				>.
			</p>

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using this service</h2>

			<p>
				This service is run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). We
				want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For
				example, that means you should be able to:
			</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
				<li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
				<li>
					get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard
				</li>
				<li>
					get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition
					software
				</li>
				<li>
					listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent
					versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				We’ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to
				understand.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk">AbilityNet</a> has advice on
				making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this service is</h2>

			<p>Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:</p>

			<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
				<!-- first bullet added for ACA-571-->
				<li>
					navigating the service using a keyboard – the focus state styles do not meet WCAG 2.1 AA for contrast ratio – this means links and fields highlighted when navigating a page with a keyboard could be hard to see for people with low vision
				</li>
				
				<li>
					JAWS screen reader software may not read out all page headings in
					Internet Explorer 11 – this is a known issue with JAWS version 18 or
					above, we recommend using a different browser to avoid this problem
				</li>

				<li>
					JAWS voice packs – some JAWS voices incorrectly read the term ‘P45’ as
					‘45p’, this is a JAWS issue only affecting some voice packs
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				DWP is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with
				the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2)
				Accessibility Regulations 2018.
			</p>
<!-- Updated paragrpah for ACA-571-->
			<p>
				This website is partially compliant with the
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21"
					>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a
				> due to the non-compliances listed below.
			</p>
<!-- Start of new section for ACA-571-->			
			<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>

			<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

			<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

			<p>When navigating the service with a keyboard, the interactive elements of the page do not meet a contrast ratio of 3:1 when focused. This fails <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">WCAG 1.4.11: non-text contrast</a> and means the areas with keyboard focus could be hard to see for people with low vision.</p>

			<p>We plan to fix this issue by 21 January 2020.</p>

<!-- End of new section for ACA-571-->
