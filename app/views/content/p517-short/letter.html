        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-margin-top-5">A new claim for Carer’s Allowance</h2>

       

        <p>
          Jane Doe has applied for Carer’s Allowance from 28 September 2020 and named you as the person they care for. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What this means for you</h2>

        <p>
          You do not need to do anything unless Jane Doe is not caring for you. You can contact us to report this.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will need to access your benefit records to deal with Jane Doe’s claim. We will not share any information about your benefits with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the Carer’s Allowance claim is paid, you will stop getting any severe disability premium you are paid as part of your benefits. 
        </p>

        <p>
          If you get an extra amount of Pension Credit for severe disability, or pay reduced council tax, these benefits could be also affected. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Contact the department that deals with your benefit if you need to check whether Carer’s Allowance will affect your payments.
        </p>
